Alright so let's get a few house keeping things out of the way, I ran this several times using the python 3 shell and it worked. This is something that any machine can download so if the code throws a hissy fit and spews out an error then idk what to do
Another thing is that this is code for python 3, let me repeat PYTHON 3. Not python 2, PYTHON 3.
To get to the path I actually finished answer the questions with n y y y n. Doing any other combination will present you with things that are not path1.
By the way path1 is the only "finished" path because these paths take a lot of time and the project itself is very draining for reasons I will go into soon.

----------------THE AMBITION PART-----------------
Okay so this project is a very personal one to me because as the code states I attempted suicide on october 10th 2018. Even though it has been over a month the wounds are still fresh upon me to the point where hearing the phrase I'm fine will make me wince
I wanted to show the hopelessness someone thinking about taking their own life goes through while not putting the player in that position, but instead putting them in the position of watching one of their friends, Riley, go through this and in turn the gameplay
will result in the hopelessness of it all. Such as the fact that the player's choices will not matter in the grand scheme of things as Riley will always die. There is no way to save them at all and I did that on purpose, because to be in that position, to feel like you don't
matter is awful. To feel as though your actions have no consequence and that your life is effectively worthless and meaningless is something I  am struggling with to this very day, and honestly I doubt I'll ever come out on top of that struggle.
Also let's talk about Riley for a minute and why they are the way they are. I picked a unisex name and made their gender ambiguous to give the player more relatability to them, but the fact that I use they/them pronouns was also because suicide in
lgbt youths is substantially higher than in those who are not and therefore by using agender pronouns that also ties into the lgbt community as well.
Going back to the personal relationship I have with this, the project is draining to do. Having to think about suicide and how I felt when writing the strings for this is just tiring. I don't like to think about the time I almost drank a concoction of nyquil and bleach it's
not a memory I look back on and think fondly of. I honestly am planning something much lighter for the javascript project because this was just draining.
The programming itself was weird since I knew what I was doing most of the time and the few snags I hit along the way were frustrating but eventually I got around them, the issue is that I can't work on this project for long periods of time because it's just that draining.
I will say this however, Project Riley isn't going to stop here. I have plans for it later and I do intend to release an actual game for it, but for now I just need a break.

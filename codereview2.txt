Your code didn't run due to an indentation error, but I've seen you run it in class, so that's something we might want to discuss in person in class tomorrow. Otherwise, this looks great. I think it's a great project, and you just need to work on fleshing out some of the other paths and making sure it runs without error for the final submission.

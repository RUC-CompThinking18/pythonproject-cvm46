# Comments
You had lots of line-by-line comments throughout. It would have been good to see a bit more of a robust comment documenting, for example, the Game class and how it will be used in the game.

# Code Quality
Given the amount of code you have here, I think you do well with managing it all. I would recommend you figure out a way, like using recursively called functions, to avoid those big nested if-then statements. I never got the actual ending because ending was called but should have been self.ending. Overall, you managed this section well.

# Ambition
This is a hugely ambitious project handled well. I would like to get a little more sense of what the other paths might look like, but, overall it was very affecting.
